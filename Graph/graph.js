// Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Itâ€™s used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

// In graph degree is the number of edges going throw the vertices

// path is collection of edges throw which we can go to one vertices to another 

// connected graph - if for  every tow vertices there is conection between them

// min number of edges in a connected graph is n-1 

// adjecency list in which we have Arraylist of vertices and every vertices will have there own Array of verties with whom they are directly connected
